# Loan Approval Prediction
Loan Approval Prediction :

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Loan Approval (1).ipynb) that focuses on predicting loan approval status. The project involves in-depth data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Python to understand the various factors influencing loan approval.

Project Overview :

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model to determine whether a loan will be approved or not based on various applicant characteristics. The notebook delves into:

Data Loading and Inspection: Loading and initial examination of the train and test datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive exploration of features and the target variable (Loan_Status) using statistical summaries and various visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
Feature Understanding: Detailed analysis of independent variables such as Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, and Property_Area.
Target Variable Analysis: Specific focus on the categorical Loan_Status variable, including frequency distributions and graphical representations.

Technologies and Libraries :

The project is developed using Python and leverages the following key libraries:
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.

Dataset :
The project utilizes two primary datasets:
train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv: The training dataset containing applicant information and their corresponding loan status.
test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv: The test dataset for evaluating the trained model's performance.

How to Run the Notebook :
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). You can install them via pip:

// Bash
"pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn"

Place the train_u6lujuX_CVtuZ9i.csv and test_Y3wMUE5_7gLdaTN.csv files in the appropriate directory as referenced in the notebook (or update the file paths within the notebook).

Open the Loan Approval (1).ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the data exploration and analysis steps.
